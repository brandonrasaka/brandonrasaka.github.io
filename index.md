# Hello there!

![Hello there!](/assets/images/self-portrait.jpg)

I'm a current student at Columbia Basin College, all set to graduate in December 2021 with my BAS in Cyber Security. My goal after I graduate is to work as a cybersecurity engineer or a cybersecurity researcher. However, I'm also open to working in anything related to cybersecurity or computers, such as networking, information technology, databases, etc.

I made this website as a way to showcase some of the work I've done. What about a resume? Of course, I have a resume, but I've worked very hard to keep it clean, limited, and tailored to each job application. What about LinkedIn? You can definitely check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonrasaka/), but that's geared more toward professional experiences and for social media. Sure, there's a Projects section, but my website gives me the ability to present a little more casual voice. When you read my website, I want you to get to know the _real ME_.

Here's what you'll find in each section of this site.

## Projects (Blog)

This section is basically a blog about my cybersecurity passions and interests, but it's mostly describing projects I've worked on. There's dates for each project, which are approximately when I completed them. That way, you can kinda get a sense of my progress. They're posted with the most recent projects on the top.

## About

This is where you can learn more about you I am, other than as a cybersecurity student seeking employment and showing off my projects. I talk about how I got into cyber, what I did before, and some of my other interests like geology and literature.

## Contact

Obviously, this is where you can find my contact information. You can email me or connect with me on LinkedIn. I also have a link to my GitHub, but I don't have a whole lot on there yet. My biggest GitHub project right now is this website, which is hosted through GitHub Pages.

You might think, "Well, what about Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc?" I'm not really big into social media. I technically have accounts for some of them, but I don't spend any time on them. I've never posted to Twitter (except one time, where it was a requirement to apply for a scholarship), and I haven't even read anything on Facebook in several months. So, I'm not going to link to them here because there's nothing to see.
