# Hello there!

![Hello there!](/assets/images/self-portrait.jpg)

I'm a current student at Columbia Basin College, all set to graduate in December 2021 with my BAS in Cyber Security. My goal after I graduate is to work as a cybersecurity engineer or a cybersecurity researcher. However, I'm also open to working in anything related to cybersecurity or computers, such as networking, information technology, databases, etc.

I made this website as a way to showcase some of the work I've done. Isn't that what a resume for? Of course, I have a resume, but I've worked very hard to keep it clean, limited, and tailored to each job application. This site doesn't outline my employment history, but is a way to document some of my cybersecurity adventures. You should also definitely check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonrasaka/) to read about my other achievements and my work history, but this website gives me the ability to present myself with a little more of a casual voice. When you read my website, I want you to get to know the _real me_.
