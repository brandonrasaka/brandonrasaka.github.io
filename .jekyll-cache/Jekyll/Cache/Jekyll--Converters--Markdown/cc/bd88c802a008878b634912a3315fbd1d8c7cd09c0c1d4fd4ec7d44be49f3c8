I"ó<p>Right now I have 3 jobs, plus Iâ€™m president of my schoolâ€™s cybersecurity club (Cyberhawks). Needless to say, I have quite a bit on my plate, but itâ€™s a ton of fun! Here are some of the things Iâ€™m currently working on:</p>

<h2 id="applications-of-5g-technology">Applications of 5G Technology</h2>

<p>As a tech student intern at <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)</a>, Iâ€™m working on projects aimed at scientifically exploring applications of <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/pnnl-5g-innovation-studio">5G technology</a>. Hereâ€™s a look at PNNLâ€™s 5G Studio:</p>

<p>What Iâ€™ve worked on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ESXi server and virtual machines</li>
  <li>Security Onion</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cybersecurity-testbed-environment">Cybersecurity Testbed Environment</h2>

<p>Another PNNL project Iâ€™m involved with his developing a nuclear power plant testbed environment for <a href="https://nuclearenergy.pnnl.gov/cybersecurity.stm">cybersecurity awareness training</a>.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™ve worked on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>OpenStack</li>
  <li>Security Onion</li>
  <li>Windows Domain Controller</li>
  <li>Apache web servers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="industrial-control-systems-cybersecurity-lab-book">Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Lab Book</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/work-progress/marcraft-lab.jpg" alt="Marcraft Lab" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.marcraft.com/">Marcraft Educational Technologies Group (ETG)</a> is in the business of producing educational material to sell to colleges and universities. In particular, Marcraft develops technical courses, such as <em>Intro to Computers</em> and <em>Intro to Networking</em>. They also write courses designed to help students prepare for certification exams like the CompTIA A+ and Network+.</p>

<p>My role at Marcraft started out as a reviewer and tester of a book currently in development on the cybersecurity of ICS. That includes installing and configuring the operating systems and software for the entire lab setup, with components such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WAMP and LAMP stacks</li>
  <li>multiple networks with routers and switches</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi with DNS and DHCP configured to simulate an ISP</li>
  <li>PLCs programmed with Ladder Logic</li>
</ul>

<p>After the initial set-up, I have been working through all the labs that were already written to ensure they are written accurately. I have also modified and written several additional labs, and integrated the Damn Vulnerable Web Application with a customized front-end for multiple labs and courses.</p>

<h2 id="canvas-shell-design-for-college-course">Canvas Shell Design for College Course</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/work-progress/canvas-geology-activities.png" alt="Geology 101 Canvas Activities" class="img-left" width="600" /></p>

<p>Canvas is a widely-used Learning Management System (LMS) that is used by Columbia Basin College for submitting and grading assignments, quizzes, exams, and discussion forums. Making use of my MS in Geology, I teach Geology 101 at the same school Iâ€™m attending for cybersecurity. In response to COVID-19 and the lockdowns, I adapted my course for an online curriculum. I recorded lesson videos, wrote quizzes and exams, and adapted lab assignments in a way that would work well for students taking the course online. Even when the pandemic ends and classes can resume as normal, my Geology 101 course will continue to be a class that remote students can take and have a good experience with.</p>

<h2 id="canvas-shell-design-for-college-club">Canvas Shell Design for College Club</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/work-progress/cyberhawks-homepage.gif" alt="Cyberhawks Home Page" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Clubs can also use Canvas for administration, and recently this has become a new requirement for all clubs at CBC. As president, I have been overseeing and directing the planning and implementation of creating a user-friendly Canvas experience for new and returning club members alike. Since the courses at CBC are primarily aimed at teaching conceptual knowledge, my goal as the Cyberhaws president is to provide the best opportunities for applied learning. Our Canvas shell will have myriad resources and challenges for members to extend themselves outside of the classroom and challenge themselves.</p>

<h2 id="college-club-charter-draft">College Club Charter Draft</h2>

<p>Another work in progress for me as Cyberhawks president is drafting a club charter. If the club ever had a charter before, itâ€™s nowhere to be found. Since I obviously wonâ€™t be president forever, I want to set the club and its leaders up for success now and in the future. So I have been working hard at writing a charter that outlines the clubâ€™s mission and the policies and procedures for administration.</p>
