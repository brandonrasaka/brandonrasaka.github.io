I"Á<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Defending information and operational technology networks is of vital importance. As has been demonstrated in attacks such as the Colonial Pipeline incident, the Stuxnet attack on an Iranian nuclear facility, and the Russian attack on Ukraine‚Äôs power grid, vulnerable critical infrastructure and industrial systems are extremely costly, both in terms of money as well as in human life. In this project, I set up a physical testbed environment with built-in vulnerabilities to demonstrate a successful penetration from outside of a private network. I exploited an open logical port and weak passwords to gain access to a computer with control over an industrial process. Based on the results of this experiment, I proposed and implemented several solutions to harden the network against similar attacks.</p>

<p>The following is the text of the paper I wrote detailing a project for my ethical hacking class.</p>

<p>Information technology (IT) is probably what most people most often think about when considering cyber security. However, there is another, equally important system of technologies that also concerns cyber security. Operational technology (OT) involves sensors, controllers, and other physical mechanisms that might be exploited, not to steal information, but to disrupt industrial processes and critical infrastructure. NIST Special Publication 800-37 states, ‚ÄúExamples include industrial control systems, building management systems, fire control systems, and physical access control mechanisms‚Äù (Joint Task Force, 2018). The balance between confidentiality, integrity, and availability leans very heavily in favor of availability and integrity for OT networks when compared to the high emphasis on confidentiality for IT systems. Special care must be taken to protect OT networks from attacks, especially when they are part of critical infrastructure that protect the lives and well-being of people.
In this project, I explored the risks associated with an insecure OT network that was combined with the IT network. After setting up my testing environment, I first played the part of a malicious outside attacker penetrating the network and taking control of key devices. Then I switched hats to play the part of a cyber security engineer to protect the network and propose policies to management for further hardening. In this scenario, I attacked a fictitious corporation hosting their own website, called AcmeCo. I conducted the project in a closed and controlled, but physical environment ‚Äì every device I used was a real, physical device (as opposed to virtual). Figure 1 shows the topology for the lab setup, including the attacker‚Äôs home network, a simulated Internet service provider (ISP), and an IT/OT network for the target corporation. The setup is described below.</p>
