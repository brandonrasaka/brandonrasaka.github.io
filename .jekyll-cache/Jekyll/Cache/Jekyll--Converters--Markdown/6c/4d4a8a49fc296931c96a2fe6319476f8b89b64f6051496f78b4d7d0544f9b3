I"?<p>As president of my school’s cybersecurity club, the Cyberhawks, I wanted to produce a video that we could use to advertise the club. I made one last year that was selfie-style and pretty cheesy. This year I wanted it to be much more professional. At first I was thinking of recording different club members doing cool things, but the script kept coming out really bad and I just had a bad feeling about the whole idea. Plus, COVID makes it not such a good idea to get together unnecessarily right now.</p>

<p>Then I came up with the idea of doing an animated video. I frequently watched videos on Wideo as inspiration, but I didn’t ever buy anything from them. I’m no animator, but I know my way around PowerPoint, so I put something together. Did you know you can make videos on PowerPoint? Yep! You have to get the animation and transition timings just right, but it’s possible. In the end, you save the file as MP4, and BAM! you’ve got yourself a video. Here’s a couple of screenshots of my slides andA Animation Pane:</p>

<p>I’ll update this post soon to get a brief tutorial written for how I did some of it, but for now, just enjoy the fruits of my labors:</p>
