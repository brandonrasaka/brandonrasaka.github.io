      <p>My work at Marcraft has been setting up a physical testing environment for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) cyber security. Most of the time, when people set up a cyber security testing environment, it is a virtual one, either through virtualization software like VMware or VirtualBox. However, we wanted to be as realistic as possible, so we made sure to use real, physical devices and cables.</p>
