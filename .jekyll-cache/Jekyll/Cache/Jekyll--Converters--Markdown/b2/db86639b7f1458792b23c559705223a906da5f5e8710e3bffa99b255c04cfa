I"<p>This tool is so cool, I think it’s worthy of mention. It’s not exactly a “project,” so it’s kinda weird that I’m putting it my projects section, but my projects section is basically a blog, so there you go.</p>

<p>What is Greenshot? It’s a totally <em>awesome</em> screenshot application. I learned about it from the <a href="https://www.thecybermentor.com/">Cyber Mentor</a> (Heath Adams) on his <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/">Practical Ethical Hacking</a> course on Udemy.</p>

<p>“But what gives? It takes screenshots, so what? I can just press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prt sc</code> and take screenshots, or I can use the Snipping Tool, so who cares?” Oh, but this is so much more!!!</p>
