<p>Iâ€™m a current student at Columbia Basin College, all set to graduate in December 2021 with my BAS in Cyber Security. My goal after I graduate is to work as a cybersecurity engineer or a cybersecurity researcher. However, Iâ€™m also open to working in anything related to cybersecurity or computers, such as networking, information technology, databases, etc.</p>

<p>I made this website as a way to showcase some of the work Iâ€™ve done. Isnâ€™t that what a resume for? Of course, I have a resume, but Iâ€™ve worked very hard to keep it clean, limited, and tailored to each job application. This site doesnâ€™t outline my employment history, but is a way to document some of my cybersecurity adventures. You should also definitely check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonrasaka/">my LinkedIn profile</a> to read about my other achievements and my work history, but this website gives me the ability to present myself with a little more of a casual voice. When you read my website, I want you to get to know the <em>real me</em>.</p>
