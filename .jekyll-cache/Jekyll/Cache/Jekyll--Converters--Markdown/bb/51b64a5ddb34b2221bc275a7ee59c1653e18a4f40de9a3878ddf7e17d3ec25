I"B<p>Iâ€™m using this space as a place to take notes and document my progress on learning about Kubernetes. I have very little knowledge of containerization, so I wanted to dive in and see what I can learn. I have an ESXi server in my home that I will be using to host my VMs to install Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Here we go!</p>
