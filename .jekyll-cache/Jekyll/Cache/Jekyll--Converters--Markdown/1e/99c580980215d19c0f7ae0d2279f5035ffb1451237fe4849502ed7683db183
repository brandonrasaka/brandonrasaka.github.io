I"<p>Currently, I’m working for both Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Marcraft, an Educational Technologies Group company. For both jobs recently, I had the opportunity to set up multiple web servers in Linux. For one of these projects I also set up a whole LAMP stack and the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), but I wanted to customize it with a new look. I also wanted to have a fake front end website that has a link for “employees” to login with, which would take them to the DVWA login page.</p>
