I"˘8<p>If you want to create a website similar to this one, here is a guide for how to do it. With GitHub, you can create and host a website for free! Though you don‚Äôt have to use Jekyll, I have found it to be best option and doesn‚Äôt require a ton of HTML and CSS. Instead, Jekyll uses YAML and Markdown. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt know either one, I don‚Äôt either, not really! I know just enough to get by in creating my website, then I look up anything I don‚Äôt know. (Google-Fu is a necessary skill to have for any developer!)</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-github-repository">Set up your GitHub Repository</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create GitHub account. My username is just my first and last name: <em>brandonrasaka</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create new repo and name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[username].github.io</code></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For example, mine is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brandonrasaka.github.io</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download and install <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When prompted, sign in to GitHub</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it finishes installing, you will see a list of Your repositories, including the one you just made</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select it, then click the Clone button. This creates a new folder for storing all the files in the repo. Any changes you make in any file in the folder you can then ‚Äúpush‚Äù to the repo on GitHub</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="install-jekyll">Install Jekyll</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Follow Jekyll‚Äôs official guides <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">here</a> to install Jekyll and its dependencies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If on Windows, open PowerShell or Command Prompt and navigate to your GitHub repo directory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bundle the site‚Äôs contents and make it available on a local server</p>

    <pre><code><span style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)">&gt;</span> bundle exec jekyll serve</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="get-the-hacker-theme-and-start-customizing">Get the <em>Hacker</em> Theme and Start Customizing</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download <em>Hacker</em> theme from <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker">https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can obviously pick your own theme and don‚Äôt have to use this one. There are a number of sources for downloading Jekyll themes, which you can Google-Fu for. Also, the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/">Jekyll documentation site</a> has a list of theme sources as well.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extract the contents of the download to your repo folder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate your web browser to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:4000</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">127.0.0.1:4000</code>. You should see the default home page of the hacker theme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it‚Äôs time to make changes to suit your needs. For this tutorial, I‚Äôll be giving you the steps that I took to get my site how I like it, so make sure to tailor yours as needed. We‚Äôre going to be writing and editing files, so you‚Äôll want a good text editor. Personally, I prefer to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a>, but <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a> work great too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the root directory, open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. Edit its contents like shown below, but obviously change the information to match your needs, then save the file.</p>

    <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Brandon_Rasaka</span>
 <span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Get to know me and check out some of the work I've done.</span>
 <span class="na">show_downloads</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
 <span class="na">theme</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">jekyll-theme-hacker</span>
 <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Brandon_Rasaka</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There are loads of more options you can specify in this file, but this is all I have for my simple site, and it‚Äôs the basics you‚Äôll need for yours.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you refresh your browser page, you should already see some changes. For example, the top line on the page (as well as the name of the site in the browser tab) will match the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> value, and the second line will match the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">description</code> value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let‚Äôs customize your homepage. Find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code> file and copy it, renaming it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template.md</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You don‚Äôt actually have to copy it, but I find it helpful to keep a local copy of the style guide.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code>, notice the first few lines are surrounded by thre dashes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">---</code>. This is the front matter for your page. Every page in your site will contain front matter. My site‚Äôs home page (index.md) has the following front matter:</p>

    <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="s">---</span>
 <span class="s">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">default</span>
 <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Home</span>
 <span class="na">nav_order</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">1</span>
 <span class="s">---</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Let me explain what each of these means.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Layout: There are different layout templates, usually multiple styles with each Jekyll theme. The Hacker theme has only two layouts that are nearly identical: default and post. The template for these is stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> directory as HTML files, but there are several variables and scripts that use the <em>Liquid</em> language to call pages and variable from elsewhere in the site. For example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default.html</code> layout has this line:</p>

        <div class="language-liquid highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">include</span><span class="w"> </span>header.html<span class="p">%}</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>This tells it to insert the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes/header.html</code> at that point, which itself is more HTML. So you can nest HTML within HTML using these variables.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Title: This is pretty self-explanatory. It‚Äôs the title of the page. But more importantly, it‚Äôs also a variable that can be called elsewhere. For example, my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes/header.html</code> file contains the following loop:</p>

        <div class="language-liquid highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  &lt;nav class="main-nav"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
          <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">assign</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">navigation_pages</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">site</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">html_pages</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">sort</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'nav_order'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
          <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">navigation_pages</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
              <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">nav_order</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="<span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>" <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">page</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span> class="active"<span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">endif</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>&gt;<span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">endif</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
          <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">endfor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
      &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>I‚Äôm not going to explain every element in this bit of code, but notice the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{{ p.title }}</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;li&gt;</code> line. That‚Äôs part of an If-THEN statement in a FOR loop that is calling each Markdown (.md) page <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p</code> in the root directory (known as navigation pages) and using their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> variables as the name of each link in the navigation bar in the header of every page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>nav_order: I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt remember if this was part of the default front matter when I downloaded the theme, or if it‚Äôs something I added later. But this tells the above loop in which order to display the links for each navigation page. So my home page (index.md) has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nav_order: 1</code>, my <em>About Me</em> page (about.md) has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nav_order: 2</code>, and so on.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Below the front matter you can use Markdown language to fill in your home page with the content you want, following the theme.md page as a guide. The beauty of using Jekyll is that you don‚Äôt have to write HTML for every single page. The more HTML, CSS, Javascript, Liquid, Markdown, and YAML you know, the more creative you can get. But with a pre-made theme you can get to work with very little extra effort if your knowledge of these languages isn‚Äôt up to snuff. I‚Äôm still pretty new to all of these languages, and yet I built this website!</p>

    <p>I <em>did</em> tweak my header quite a bit, so I had to tinker with the HTML and CSS quite a bit to get it how I liked it, so my header won‚Äôt be quite the same as yours even if you‚Äôre using the Hacker theme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point you can make as many navigation pages as you like. Just give them a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> extension and store them in the repo‚Äôs root directory. Make sure to edit the front matter appropriately and you‚Äôre good to go!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="start-blogging">Start Blogging</h2>

<p>Okay, so now you‚Äôve got navigation pages, it‚Äôs time to start blogging. Now, I don‚Äôt use my website as a blog, per se, but I use the blogging functionality. As you can see, I use it to post my projects and tutorials. But Jekyll has some great functionality for blogging.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To write your first blog post, make a new Markdown file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> subdirectory, giving it a name with the date for a suffix in the format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yyyy-mm-dd</code>. For example, the filename for this page is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2021-09-01-creating-site-with-github-pages.md</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give the page some front matter. Again, using this page as an example, the front matter is</p>

    <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="s">---</span>
 <span class="s">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
 <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Creating</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">A</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Website</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">with</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">GitHub</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Pages</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">and</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Jekyll"</span>
 <span class="na">permalink</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/:year/:month/:day/:title/</span>
 <span class="s">---</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>The layout and title variables are the same as before, but now there‚Äôs a new one: permalink. This tells the site what the URL for this page (after the domain name) should be.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
