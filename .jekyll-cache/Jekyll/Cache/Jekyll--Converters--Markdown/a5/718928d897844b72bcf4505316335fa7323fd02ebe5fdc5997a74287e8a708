I""<p>I have a personal project writing a work of fiction and I recently decided to update how I keep my notes. I used to just use Google Keep Notes because I could easily write down ideas on my phone. But it makes for terrible review of my notes when I’m actually writing the story and building the fictional world. I wanted something with better organization, but also something I could share with my writing group, and <em>only</em> my writing group. I don’t want to share it with the rest of the world until it is ready for publication.</p>
