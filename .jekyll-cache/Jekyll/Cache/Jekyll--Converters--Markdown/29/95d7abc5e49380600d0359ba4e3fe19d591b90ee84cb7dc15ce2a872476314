I"<p>If you want to create a website similar to this one, here is a guide for how to do it. With GitHub, you can create and host a website for free! Though you don’t have to use Jekyll, I have found it to be best option and doesn’t require a ton of HTML and CSS. Instead, Jekyll uses YAML and Markdown. Don’t worry if you don’t know either one, I don’t either, not really! I know just enough to get by in creating my website, then I look up anything I don’t know. (Google-Fu is a necessary skill to have for any developer!)</p>
