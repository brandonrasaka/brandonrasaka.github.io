<p><img src="/assets/images/self-portrait.jpg" alt="Hello there!" /></p>

<p>I’m a current student at Columbia Basin College, all set to graduate in December 2021 with my BAS in Cyber Security. My goal after I graduate is to work as a cybersecurity engineer or a cybersecurity researcher. However, I’m also open to working in anything related to cybersecurity or computers, such as networking, information technology, databases, etc.</p>

<p>I made this website as a way to showcase some of the work I’ve done. What about a resume? Of course, I have a resume, but I’ve worked very hard to keep it clean, limited, and tailored to each job application. What about LinkedIn? You can definitely check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonrasaka/">my LinkedIn profile</a>, but that’s geared more toward professional experiences and for social media. Sure, there’s a Projects section, but my website gives me the ability to present a little more casual voice. When you read my website, I want you to get to know the <em>real ME</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s what you’ll find in each section of this site.</p>

<h2 id="projects-blog">Projects (Blog)</h2>

<p>This section is basically a blog about my cybersecurity passions and interests, but it’s mostly describing projects I’ve worked on. There’s dates for each project, which are approximately when I completed them. That way, you can kinda get a sense of my progress. They’re posted with the most recent projects on the top.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>This is where you can learn more about you I am, other than as a cybersecurity student seeking employment and showing off my projects. I talk about how I got into cyber, what I did before, and some of my other interests like geology and literature.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>Obviously, this is where you can find my contact information. You can email me or connect with me on LinkedIn. I also have a link to my GitHub, but I don’t have a whole lot on there yet. My biggest GitHub project right now is this website, which is hosted through GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>You might think, “Well, what about Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc?” I’m not really big into social media. I technically have accounts for some of them, but I don’t spend any time on them. I’ve never posted to Twitter (except one time, where it was a requirement to apply for a scholarship), and I haven’t even read anything on Facebook in several months. So, I’m not going to link to them here because there’s nothing to see.</p>
