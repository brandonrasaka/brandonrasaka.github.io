I"É<p>This tool is so cool, I think it‚Äôs worthy of mention. What is Greenshot? It‚Äôs a totally <em>awesome</em> screenshot application. I learned about it from the <a href="https://www.thecybermentor.com/">Cyber Mentor</a> (Heath Adams) on his <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/">Practical Ethical Hacking</a> course on Udemy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut what gives? It takes screenshots, so what? I can just press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prt sc</code> and take screenshots, or I can use the Snipping Tool, so who cares?‚Äù Oh, but this is so much more!!!</p>

<p>By default, the shortcut for taking a screenshot with Greenshot is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prt sc</code> key. When you press it, you get a fullscreen crosshairs and a zoomed-in view so you get a pixel-scale view of crosshairs.</p>

<p>As you click and drag the mouse, you‚Äôll see a green semi-transparent box draw on your screen, along with the pixel dimensions of the box being drawn.</p>
