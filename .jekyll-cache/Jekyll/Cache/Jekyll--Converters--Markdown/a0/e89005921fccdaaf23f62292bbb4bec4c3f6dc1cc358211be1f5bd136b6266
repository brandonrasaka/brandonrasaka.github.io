<p>I’m a current student at Columbia Basin College, all set to graduate in December 2021 with my BAS in Cyber Security. My goal after I graduate is to work as a cybersecurity engineer or a cybersecurity researcher. However, I’m also open to working in anything related to cybersecurity or computers, such as networking, information technology, databases, etc.</p>

<p>I made this website as a way to showcase some of the work I’ve done. What about a resume? Of course, I have a resume, but I’ve worked very hard to keep it clean, limited, and tailored to each job application. What about LinkedIn? You can definitely check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonrasaka/">my LinkedIn profile</a>, but that’s geared more toward professional experiences and for social media. Sure, there’s a Projects section, but my website gives me the ability to present a little more casual voice. When you read my website, I want you to get to know the <em>real ME</em>.</p>
