I"ÿ<p>As president of my schoolâ€™s cybersecurity club, the Cyberhawks, I wanted to produce a video that we could use to advertise the club. I made one last year that was selfie-style and pretty cheesy. This year I wanted it to be much more professional. At first I was thinking of recording different club members doing cool things, but the script kept coming out really bad and I just had a bad feeling about the whole idea. Plus, COVID makes it not such a good idea to get together unnecessarily right now.</p>
