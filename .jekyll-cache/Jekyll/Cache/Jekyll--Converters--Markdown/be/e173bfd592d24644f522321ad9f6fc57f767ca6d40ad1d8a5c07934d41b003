<p><img src="/assets/images/portrait.jpg" alt="Hello there!" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m a current student at Columbia Basin College, all set to graduate in December 2021 with my BAS in Cyber Security. My goal after I graduate is to work as a cybersecurity engineer or a cybersecurity researcher. However, Iâ€™m also open to working in anything related to cybersecurity or computers, such as networking, information technology, databases, etc.</p>

<p>I made this website as a way to showcase some of the work Iâ€™ve done. What about a resume? Of course, I have a resume, but Iâ€™ve worked very hard to keep it clean, limited, and tailored to each job application. What about LinkedIn? You can definitely check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonrasaka/">my LinkedIn profile</a>, but thatâ€™s geared more toward professional experiences and for social media. Sure, thereâ€™s a Projects section, but my website gives me the ability to present a little more casual voice. When you read my website, I want you to get to know the <em>real ME</em>.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find in each section of this site.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve treated this section kinda like a blog. Thereâ€™s dates for each project, which are approximately when I completed them. That way, you can kinda get a sense of my progress. Theyâ€™re posted with the most recent projects on the top.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>This is where you can learn more about you I am, other than as a cybersecurity student seeking employment and showing off my projects. I talk about how I got into cyber, what I did before, and some of my other interests like geology and literature.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>Obviously, this is where you can find my contact information. You can email me or connect with me on LinkedIn. I also have a link to my GitHub, but I donâ€™t have a whole lot on there yet. My biggest GitHub project right now is this website, which is hosted through GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>You might think, â€œWell, what about Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc?â€ Iâ€™m not really big into social media. I technically have accounts for some of them, but I donâ€™t spend any time on them. Iâ€™ve never posted to Twitter (except one time, where it was a requirement to apply for a scholarship), and I havenâ€™t even read anything on Facebook in several months. So, Iâ€™m not going to link to them here because thereâ€™s nothing to see.</p>
