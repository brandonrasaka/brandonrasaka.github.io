I"Q<p>I was lucky enough to buy a couple of extra computers from an auction, but usually having extra computers and networking computers for experimenting and penetration testing just isnâ€™t feasible for students. In my <a href="/2021/06/13/install-virtual-machines/">previous project</a>, I gave instructions on how to install virtual machines in preparation to set up a virtual lab using Oracle VirtualBox. Here Iâ€™m going to explain how to actually allow them to talk to each other and to the Internet.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ll expand on this project page later to explain some of the <em>why</em>â€™s, but I wanted to get the steps out there right away.</p>

<p>Assuming you already have 2 VMs, weâ€™re going to start by allowing each of them to talk to the Internet.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the VM is running, shut it down (donâ€™t just save the machine state, but actually turn it off)</li>
  <li>With the VM highlighted in VirtualBox, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Network</strong> and make sure the <strong>Enable Network Adapter</strong> box is checked. By default, it should be.</li>
  <li>Also by default, the <em>Attached to</em> drop-down menu should be on <strong>NAT</strong>. If not, select <strong>NAT</strong>. This will allow the VM to get to the Internet</li>
  <li>Go ahead and click <strong>OK</strong> to save the settings, then start the VM to check</li>
  <li>Open a web browser and check if you can reach the Internet</li>
  <li>Now run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> (for Linux) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipconfig</code> (for Windows) to discover your IP address. It should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.2.15</code>, since thatâ€™s the default for the <em>NAT</em> network option</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, good. Now itâ€™s time to let them talk to each other.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shut down the VMs again, then open up the Network settings for each one</li>
  <li>In VirtualBox, click <strong>File &gt; Host Network Manager</strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create</strong> to make a new adapter. This is basically like getting a new NIC for your computer, but itâ€™s also like getting a new router to connect multiple computers together.</li>
  <li>For the purposes of this tutorial, just select the <strong>Configure Adapter Automatically</strong> option, and on the <em>DHCP Server</em> tab, check the box to <strong>Enable Server</strong>. If you wanted, you could set the network manually, and then also set the IP addresses on each machine manually. You would want to do this if you were hosting a web server, or an FTP server, or something, but in this case the automatic settings are just fine.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong></li>
  <li>Now, for each VM, open the Network Settings again</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Adapter 2</strong> tab and enable it with the checkbox</li>
  <li>Now, attach <em>this</em> adapter to the Host, but select <strong>Host-only Adapter</strong> from the drop-down menu</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> option, then beside the <em>MAC Address</em> box, click the Refresh icon</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and then start up your VMs</li>
  <li>This time when you find the IP addresses, you should still have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.2.15</code> address, but it should also have another address in the same range as the Host-only adapter you set up earlier. Find those IP addresses, and then try to ping them from each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>CONGRATULATIONS! You now have a virtual lab you can use for some basic penetration testing!</p>
