I"ý<p>I was lucky enough to buy a couple of extra computers from an auction, but usually having extra computers and networking computers for experimenting and penetration testing just isnâ€™t feasible for students. In my <a href="/2021/06/13/install-virtual-machines/">previous project</a>, I gave instructions on how to install virtual machines in preparation to set up a virtual lab using Oracle VirtualBox. Here Iâ€™m going to explain how to actually allow them to talk to each other and to the Internet.</p>
