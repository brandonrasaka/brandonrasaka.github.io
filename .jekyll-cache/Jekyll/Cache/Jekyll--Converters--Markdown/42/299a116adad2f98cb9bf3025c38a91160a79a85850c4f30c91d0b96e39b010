I"<p>I have a personal project writing a work of fiction and I recently decided to update how I keep my notes. I used to just use Google Keep Notes because I could easily write down ideas on my phone. But it makes for terrible review of my notes when I’m actually writing the story and building the fictional world. I wanted something with better organization, but also something I could share with my writing group, and <em>only</em> my writing group. I don’t want to share it with the rest of the world until it is ready for publication.</p>

<p>So I decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme">jekyll-rtd-theme</a> to create a documentation website, then host it on a local web server, then set up a VPN connection so my writing group can view it.</p>

<p>I followed the instructions on Digital Ocean for this and I don’t think I can write better instructions than they. However, for the sake of demonstrating what I did and how my instance differed from their instructions, I will outline the main points of what I did.</p>
