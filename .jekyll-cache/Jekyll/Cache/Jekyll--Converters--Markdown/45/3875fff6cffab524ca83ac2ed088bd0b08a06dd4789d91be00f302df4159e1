I"³<p>Right now I have 3 jobs, plus Iâ€™m president of my schoolâ€™s cybersecurity club (Cyberhawks). Needless to say, I have quite a bit on my plate, but itâ€™s a ton of fun! Here are some of the things Iâ€™m currently working on:</p>

<h2 id="applications-of-5g-technology">Applications of 5G Technology</h2>

<p>As a tech student intern at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Iâ€™m working on a couple of projects aimed at scientifically exploring applications of 5G technology.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ESXi server and virtual machines</li>
  <li>Security Onion for log analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cybersecurity-testbed-environment">Cybersecurity Testbed Environment</h2>

<p>Another PNNL project Iâ€™m involved with his developing a nuclear power plant testbed environment for cybersecurity awareness training.</p>

<ul>
  <li>OpenStack</li>
  <li>Security Onion</li>
  <li>Windows Domain Controller</li>
  <li>Apache web servers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="industrial-control-systems-cybersecurity-lab-book">Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Lab Book</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.marcraft.com/">Marcraft Educational Technologies Group (ETG)</a> is in the business of producing educational material to sell to colleges and universities. In particular, Marcraft develops technical courses, such as <em>Intro to Computers</em> and <em>Intro to Networking</em>. They also write courses designed to help students prepare for certification exams like the CompTIA A+ and Network+.</p>

<p>My role at Marcraft started out as a reviewer and tester of a book currently in development on the cybersecurity of ICS. That includes installing and configuring the operating systems and software for the entire lab setup, with components such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WAMP and LAMP stacks</li>
  <li>multiple networks with routers and switches</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi with DNS and DHCP configured to simulate an ISP</li>
  <li>PLCs programmed with Ladder Logic</li>
</ul>

<p>After the initial set-up, I have been working through all the labs that were already written to ensure they are written accurately. I have also modified and written several additional labs, and integrated the Damn Vulnerable Web Application with a customized front-end for multiple labs and courses.</p>

<p>Canvas is a widely-used Learning Management System (LMS) that is used by Columbia Basin College for submitting and grading assignments, quizzes, exams, and discussion forums. Making use of my MS in Geology, I teach Geology 101 at the same school Iâ€™m attending for cybersecurity. In response to COVID-19 and the lockdowns, I adapted my course for an online curriculum. I recorded lesson videos, wrote quizzes and exams, and adapted lab assignments in a way that would work well for students taking the course online. Even when the pandemic ends and classes can resume as normal, my Geology 101 course will continue to be a class that remote students can take and have a good experience with.</p>
