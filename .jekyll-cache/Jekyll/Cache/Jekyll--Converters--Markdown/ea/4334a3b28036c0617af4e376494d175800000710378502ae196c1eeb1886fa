I"Ò	<p>This tool is so cool, I think it‚Äôs worthy of mention. What is Greenshot? It‚Äôs a totally <em>awesome</em> screenshot application. I learned about it from the <a href="https://www.thecybermentor.com/">Cyber Mentor</a> (Heath Adams) on his <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/">Practical Ethical Hacking</a> course on Udemy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut what gives? It takes screenshots, so what? I can just press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prt sc</code> and take screenshots, or I can use the Snipping Tool, so who cares?‚Äù Oh, but this is so much more!!!</p>

<p>By default, the shortcut for taking a screenshot with Greenshot is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prt sc</code> key. When you press it, you get a fullscreen crosshairs and a zoomed-in view so you get a pixel-scale view of crosshairs.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/greenshot/crosshairs.png" alt="Fullscreen Crosshairs" class="center-image" width="680" /></p>

<p>As you click and drag the mouse, you‚Äôll see a green semi-transparent box draw on your screen, along with the pixel dimensions of the box being drawn.</p>

<p>Then, when you let off the mouse button, you get a little action menu like this one. If you select the top option, a <strong>Save As‚Ä¶</strong> dialog box will pop up and give you the option of giving the image a name, filetype (BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, TIFF, GREENSHOT, or ICO), and selecting the directory to save it to. Saving it as a GREENSHOT type allows you to open it in Greenshot‚Äôs image editor at a later time. I‚Äôll talk more about the image editor in a moment.</p>

<p>If you select the second option, it will save the image according to the default configuration, which you can change (more on that later, too). You can also copy it to the clipboard, print it, or automatically copy/paste it into one of several applications listed, or even upload it to Imgur! You can also click <strong>Close</strong> (or press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Esc</code>) if you want to discard and start over.</p>

<p>You can also start using Greenshot from your System Tray. After you install it, there‚Äôs an</p>
