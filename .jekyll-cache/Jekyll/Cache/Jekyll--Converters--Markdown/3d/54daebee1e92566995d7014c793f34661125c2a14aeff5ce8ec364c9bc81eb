I"õ<p>The National Cyber League (NCL) is a fun (mostly) Jeopardy style capture the flag (CTF) competition that has two seasons every year: the Spring Season and the Fall Season. NCL is only for college students and is a <em>great</em> learning opportunity. At the time of this writing, I am in my last few weeks of school getting my BAS in Cybersecurity, so this Fall Season is my last time playing. I wrote this post as a way to give newer players some basic tips to help springboard your learning.</p>
