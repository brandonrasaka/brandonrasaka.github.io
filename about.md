# Me, at a glance

This isn't my first rodeo through school. I started by getting a bachelor's in Geology at Brigham Young University - Idaho, then I went on to get my master's in Geology from Baylor University. I spent a few years teaching an online natural disasters course, submitting countless resumes for positions in a failing field, and working at a rental car agency. Eventually, I decided it was time to gain some education and skills in a different arena.

Now, I'm in an internship at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory through the SULI program. I also work for Marcraft/ETG, a company that develops training courses with hands-on equipment. They sell to educators, not to students, so they're often selling an entire course, which comes with a textbook, lab book, and a whole kit of devices, like a pre-configured Raspberry Pi, a laptop with Kali and Windows, several routers, a server, etc. At Marcraft I am editing and writing labs for their course in Industrial Control System Cyber Security. Unfortunately, my work at Marcraft will be put on hold during my internship with PNNL.

I'm a very busy man right now! In addition to these jobs, I also work for CBC as an adjunct instructor teaching Geology 101 online. I'm also the president of our campus cyber security club: the Cyberhawks. I'm a husband, and the proud father of six kids!


# Cybersecurity

Is it "cyber security" (two words) or "cybersecurity" (one word)?
Most people probably couldn't care less, but pride myself on precise language. I went back and forth a lot, then I decided to settle on "cybersecurity" (one word), because that's the way it's use by NIST.

...This is how I got into cybersecurity


# Other Interests

In addition to cyber security, I have a lot of other interests. I have been in love with the outdoors since I was a kid and have come to an even greater appreciation for the Earth as I've come to understand the processes that shape it. As part of my interest in geology, I am semi-active on my YouTube channel Geology Guy, though I don’t often have the time to dedicate to it.

## Geology

I grew up in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and lived there until I was 23. I was in the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts and had a ton of fun camping and hiking in the central Oregon Cascades, mostly in the Santiam Pass. I’ve hiked all around the north, west, and south sides of Mount Jefferson, and I climbed to the very top of a mountain called Three-Fingered Jack. Its summit is so narrow only two people can stand at the top at a time!

## Artistic Endeavors

I play the guitar and sing for fun, and I love jamming out to classic rock music.

## Literature

I really like reading (usually listening to audiobooks, actually), especially fantasy and science-fiction, though I enjoy a wide range of books. I'm a huge Star Wars fan (I'm sure you fellow Star Wars fans recognize my greeting on my homepage), though I enjoy Star Trek as well. Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author of fiction, but I also like works by Robert Jordan, Douglas Adams, Lee Child, Tolkien, Pierce Brown, Richard Stark, Andy Weir, and many more. In addition to fiction, I greatly appreciate non-fiction works as well, such as 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan B. Peterson, The Dictator’s Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith, and A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson.
