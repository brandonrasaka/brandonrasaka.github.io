This tool is so cool, I think it's worthy of mention. What is Greenshot? It's a totally _awesome_ screenshot application. I learned about it from the [Cyber Mentor](https://www.thecybermentor.com/) (Heath Adams) on his [Practical Ethical Hacking](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) course on Udemy.

"But what gives? It takes screenshots, so what? I can just press `prt sc` and take screenshots, or I can use the Snipping Tool, so who cares?" Oh, but this is so much more!!!

By default, the shortcut for taking a screenshot with Greenshot is the `prt sc` key. When you press it, you get a fullscreen crosshairs and a zoomed-in view so you get a pixel-scale view of crosshairs.

As you click and drag the mouse, you'll see a green semi-transparent box draw on your screen, along with the pixel dimensions of the box being drawn.

Then, when you let off the mouse button, you get a little action menu like this one. If you select the top option, a **Save As...** dialog box will pop up and give you the option of giving the image a name, filetype (BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, TIFF, GREENSHOT, or ICO), and selecting the directory to save it to. Saving it as a GREENSHOT type allows you to open it in Greenshot's image editor at a later time. I'll talk more about the image editor in a moment.

If you select the second option, it will save the image according to the default configuration, which you can change (more on that later, too). You can also copy it to the clipboard, print it, or automatically copy/paste it into one of several applications listed, or even upload it to Imgur! You can also click **Close** (or press `Esc`) if you want to discard and start over.

You can also start using Greenshot from your System Tray. Click on the Greenshot logo in the System Tray and you can capture a region on the screen you draw (like above), or you can select the exact same region you last drew, which could be handy depending on your needs. You can also capture the current window, or you can select from a list of all your current windows. You can capture your full screen, and if you have multiple monitors you can select which one to capture (or choose both). 

Rather than capture, you can open an existing image in the image editor, selecting either an image stored somewhere on the drive, or from the clipboard. From the System Tray menu, you can open the Preferences to change the default configuration settings.
